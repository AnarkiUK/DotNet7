A well-written unit test will have three parts:

1. **Arrange**: This part will declare and instantiate variables for input and output.

1. **Act**: This part will execute the unit that you are are testing. In our case, it means calling the method that we want to test.

1. **Assert**: This part will make one or more assertions about the output an assertion is a belief that, if not true, indicates a failed test.
